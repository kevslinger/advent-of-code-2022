# Advent of Code 2022

Hi there! I'm trying to catch up on the Advent of Code from last year. 
Join me as I journey through, solving each day's challenge in Java!

The code for each day's challenge is in the respective folder. 
Code for each day is self-contained other than the `parser-utils` module, which contains parsing functions commonly used across days.

Current progress: 20 stars out of 150 (13.33%)
